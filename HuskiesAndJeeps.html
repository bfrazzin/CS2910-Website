            In the above pictures, there is Nala, Luna, and Kira. Nala is a <a href="https://animalcorner.org/dog-breeds/red-husky/Red">
            Red Siberian Husky</a>. She is around four and a half years old. Nala is a very sweet and curious girl. Luna is a <a href="https://www.pupvine.com/wooly-husky/">
            Wooly Husky</a>. Out of the three, Luna is definitely the calmest. She is happy enough to lay around outside and sniff the breeze. Kira is the third Husky pictured. She is unique 
            because she has freckles and a white patch on her back. Out of the three girls, Kira is by far the most energetic and has the traditional Husky personality traits
            (high energy, mischevious, talkative). All three of them are pictured with my Jeep.
            <br>
            <br>
            The <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/siberian-husky/">Siberian Husky</a> is a type of dog that 
            is affectionate, loyal, and playful but dignified. Everyone knows Huskies by their beautiful, often blue-colored eyes 
            as well as their stunning winter-esque coat. They're an extremely loyal and pack-oriented breed, so husky owners often 
            have multiple. Due to the husky's active mind and high levels of curiousity, their owners often times need to find ways
            to stimulate them, and, in other words, wear them out!
            <br>
            <br>
            Which is why the idea of owning a Jeep alongside huskies is a perfect pair. Huskies love the outdoors. They love investigating
            all of the new sights, smells, and everything else nature has to offer. Unfortunately, many of the common outdoors and hiking areas
            here in Colorado Springs are packed with people. While huskies typically do like interactions with other dogs and humans, I find 
            that it is more enjoyable and fulfilling for them to experience the tranquil outdoors.

            <br>
            Jeeps are fantastic vehicles to haul around dogs and, more importantly, get you to where you want to go. Many of our local offroad
            trails have great hiking areas around them, so I find myself needing an appropriate vehicle to get me there, which is where the Jeep
            comes in. <a href="https://www.jeep.com/">Jeep offers many options of vehicles to fit all needs.</a>
